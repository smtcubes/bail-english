## Description

Another reason why bail should be removed is that any incarcerated people are people still waiting for their trial. The statistic is over 90%. According to The Guardian newspaper, “Between 1999 and 2014, the number of people held in jail before trial ballooned, accounting for 99% of the total growth of America’s jailhouse population.” (Das and Awan) The majority of these people are not responsible for the crime they allegedly committed, and poor prisoners who cannot afford the bail have to remain in jail for the whole time until their trial. A tragic example of this incident is that of Kalief Browder. Browder was accused of stealing a backpack containing a $700 camera, an iPod Touch, and a credit card. Detained in 2010 as a 16 year old, Browder suffered 3 years in jail without a trial. After being held for 3 years in Rikers Island, he was released. In October 2014, however, he committed suicide in his parents’ home. In a story from the New York Times, Michael Schwirtz and Michael Winerip state, “Jennifer Gonnerman, the author of the article in The New Yorker, said in an interview on Monday that it appeared he was never able to recover from the years he spent locked alone in a cell for 23 hours a day.” (Schwirtz and Winerip) Even in jail he tried to commit suicide multiple times. As a result, as the New York Times expresses, his inmates and an officer beat him every time. The depressing story of Kalief Browder is exemplary of the injustice faced by poor prisoners. Innocent people have now been incarcerated for too long.  The ones that are exonerated are never the same as their previous selves.  This is all due to their prolonged imprisonment.  According to the Washington Post, “The 2,265 exonerees in the NRE database served a combined 20,080 years behind bars. That’s an enormous amount of wasted human potential.”  (Balko) As an example, a death row inmate, John Thompson, spent 18 years in prison before he was released.  Meanwhile, richer people may be released as the witnesses would be likely to express what truly transpired.  All of this goes to show how innocent people spend too much time in jail, and this is another reason why bail should be removed.
