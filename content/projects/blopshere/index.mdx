## Description

  A lot of times, cash bail is simply too much to pay for many families. They instead turn to private bail bond companies. These companies pay for people’s bail if they cannot afford it and they have their customers pay them a nonrefundable fee after. The most major flaw in the bond system is that even if the defendants are not accused of crime and show up to every court hearing, they are still forced to pay a fee to the bail bond company. The system is extremely corrupted, so much so that it is only legal in 2 countries- the US and the Philippines. According to John Goldkamp, a professor of criminal justice at Temple University, “It’s a very American invention. It’s really the only place in the criminal justice system where a liberty decision is governed by a profit-making businessman who will or will not take your business.” In Canada, selling bonds can earn you a 2-year prison sentence- the charge equivalent to the charge of bribing a juror. According to Mother Jones, a non-profit journalism company, at a convention for the Professional Bail Agents of the United States, the president of the association told the bond agents to avoid the IRS at all costs. In another speech by a private investigator, the investigator said that all bail agents should require clients’ Facebook and email passwords and to maintain fake Facebook pages and friend clients to keep track of them. This is extremely unethical, and many bond agents work by strategies like this to keep track of their clients. Moreover, bail agents often bribe judges, policeman, and other government officials. More than 40 percent of felony defendants released before trial paid a bail bond company in 2004, up from 24 percent a decade earlier, according to the Justice Department. The system of bail bonds is corrupt and almost universally illegal, and if bail was eliminated, then this dishonest and scandalous system would be gone with.
