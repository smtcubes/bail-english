## Paragraph

A practical reason bail should not be allowed is because rich people are rewarded for being rich. Imagine a person who has been in prison for years because he’s poor and his new cellmate gets to leave and go to a trial only after a few days solely because he is rich. This is clearly unfair and unjust. A quote from Tylt states, “Today, California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly," Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement. This quote displays that a very populated state agrees that the rich and poor are not treated equally. Another quote from Politio states, “The new [California] law, which will take effect in October 2019, will replace the old system of money-based freedom with a new one of risk assessments and preventive detention.” From this you can clearly say that California said old system was completely a money based system, rich people could definitely take advantage of it. Currently California is giving judges permission to keep someone incarcerated. Politico states, “California will continue to give local judges the sweeping authority to keep people incarcerated before they’re convicted of anything.” This quote shows that rich people will no longer be able to get out the easy way. It is obvious that the jail bail system is against poor people, and this is one of the reasons why bail should be eliminated.
